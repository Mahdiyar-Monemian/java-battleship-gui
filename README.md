-   **IDE:** Any Java-compatible IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode) recommended.

## üì¶ Installation & Run

### Prerequisites
To run this game, you only need to have **Java** installed on your machine.
-   **Download Java:** Ensure you have the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (version 11 or above) installed.
-   **Check Installation:** You can verify by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing:
    ```bash
    java -version
    javac -version
    ```

### Running the Game (Two Methods)

#### Method 1: Using an IDE (Recommended for Development)
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mahdiyar-Monemian/java-battleship-gui.git
    cd java-battleship-gui
    ```
2.  **Open the project** in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3.  **Locate the app class:** The entry point is in a file called App.java
4.  **Run the project** from within the IDE by clicking the "Run" button.

#### Method 2: From the Command Line
1.  **Clone the repository** (as shown above) and navigate into it.
2.  **Compile the Java source files:**
    ```bash
    javac -d out/src/**/*.java
    ```
    *(Note: The exact path to source files may vary. If this doesn't work, check the project structure below).*
3.  **Run the compiled game:**
    ```bash
    java -cp out App
    ```

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1.  **Setup:** The game will start by asking you to place your fleet (Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer) on your grid.
2.  **Place Ships:** Click on a ship and then click on your grid to place it. You can rotate the ship using a button.
3.  **Begin Battle:** After placing all your ships, the game begins. You and the other player take turns.
